# Amazon-Clone-v3.0
"This is my First Repo"
</br>
</br>
A simple clone of Amazon.com built using HTML and CSS. This project is part of my learning journey, inspired by a tutorial from Apna College on YouTube. Let me know if you'd like to refine it further!
</br>
</br>
I've named it v3.0 beacause I had to made some changes in the previous repositories which lead in to deleting them
